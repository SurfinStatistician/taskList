# Task List
Task list of core skills/competencies a student who knows regression should be able to do. In a perfect world, statistics instructors in social sciences programs will use this as a tool to evaluate student learning.. 

## Versions
The section for "releases" is the place to check for current versions of this task list. The project began in November 2017 with a goal of releases an initial list of regression competencies, at the level of an undergraduate statistics student who takes one course on statistics in a social sciences program, by January 31, 2017.

### Adding Content
Statistics instructors are invited to contribute ideas to this list by creating a Pull Request in Github. We expect the first version to cover regression. Future versions will add to this list and may ultimately expand beyond regression (to be determined).
